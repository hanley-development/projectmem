# Changelog

## 0.1.5

**MCP timeout hardening for stdio clients.** Projectmem's MCP tools now avoid letting git subprocesses inherit the MCP server's JSON-RPC stdin pipe, which could hang FastMCP stdio sessions on Windows even when the equivalent CLI command returned quickly.

### Fixed

- MCP-reachable git helpers now detach child-process stdin with `subprocess.DEVNULL`.
- Git commit lookup on write paths is bounded with a timeout, so tools such as `add_note` and `record_fix` do not wait forever if git stalls.
- `precheck_file` and related precheck helpers keep CLI behavior unchanged while hardening the MCP execution path.
- `pjm brief` rendering is safe on CP1252 and other non-UTF-8 Windows consoles.
- Windows hook-path tests tolerate environments where bash exits early on invalid inherited stdin.

### Tests and docs

- Added MCP stdio regression coverage for `precheck_file` and `add_note`.
- Added focused subprocess tests for the MCP-reachable git helper calls.

## 0.1.4

**The accountable-judgment release: memory that flags its own staleness instead of silently trusting (or deleting) it — plus a dashboard that opens on an all-at-a-glance Overview.** Six small features (~150 lines, no new dependencies, no schema breaks) sharpen what makes projectmem different: it never deletes a memory, it tells you when one may have gone stale, it lets you retire decisions without losing history, it lists what already failed before you try it again, it briefs you at session start, it snoozes politely when it's wrong, and it exports its judgment to CLAUDE.md for agents that don't speak MCP. Also bumps the version (the `__init__.py` / `pyproject.toml` mismatch is corrected to a single `0.1.4`).

### New: stale-memory detection — flag, never delete

Other memory tools silently decay or delete old memories (and collect bug reports about wanted memories disappearing). projectmem now does the opposite: every decision/fix/note that cites a file is cross-referenced against that file's git history, and when the file has changed substantially since the memory was logged (3+ commits, or the file no longer exists), `pjm precheck` and the MCP `precheck_file` tool flag it — *"decision [evt_…] predates 4 commits to auth.py — confirm it still holds, or retire it"*. Nothing is hidden, nothing is removed; a human (or agent) decides. Deterministic `git log` counts; no embeddings, no daemon.

### New: superseded-decision marking — retire without rewriting history

`pjm decision "switch to argon2" --supersedes <event-id>` (also on the MCP `add_decision` tool) records a new decision that retires an old one. The old event stays physically in `events.jsonl` (append-only, always), drops out of `summary.md`, and shows up in `pjm search` tagged `(superseded)`. Search output now prints event ids so the reference is one copy-paste away. A bad reference fails *before* anything is written. Together with stale detection this completes the non-destructive answer to memory decay: **detect staleness → supersede explicitly → never lose history.**

### New: `pjm brief` — the session-start briefing

One screen that answers "where was I?": active failure warnings by file, possibly-stale memories, open issues, the latest live decisions, stack-relevant gotchas from global memory, and the prevention score with a week-over-week delta. Composes data the other commands already compute; runs in milliseconds; nothing leaves the machine.

### New: precheck snooze — the polite off-switch

`pjm precheck --snooze 2h` (forms: `30m`, `2h`, `1d`) silences pre-commit warnings for a bounded window instead of pushing annoyed users to `--no-verify` (which silences forever and leaves no trace). The snooze is itself logged to memory — even the silence is audited — and while active, every commit prints one dim line saying warnings are snoozed, so a silenced warning is never mistaken for a clean check. `--unsnooze` restores warnings early; expired markers clean themselves up.

### New: failed approaches listed in precheck output

The pre-commit warning (and MCP `precheck_file`) now lists the dead ends themselves — *"What already failed here: ✗ tried CSS contain:layout (2w ago) ✗ debounced the handler (2w ago)"* — instead of just a count. The data was always in the log; now it's at the decision point. `pjm search --failed-only` lists the project's full catalogue of dead ends.

### New: `pjm export --claude-md` — judgment for agents without MCP

Compiles live memory — current decisions (with stale flags), known gotchas, and a "Do NOT retry — these already failed" section — into a marked, auto-regenerated block inside `CLAUDE.md` (`--cursor` also writes `.cursorrules`; `--stdout` previews). Any agent that reads the file inherits the project's judgment with zero MCP setup. The block is replaced in place on re-run; the rest of the file — including the `pjm init` MCP bridge block — is never touched. Superseded decisions are excluded; possibly-stale ones are flagged, not hidden.

### Fixed: walk-up discovery no longer mistakes the global store for a project

Running any `pjm` write command from a directory under `$HOME` with no initialized project used to walk up, land on `~/.projectmem/` (the machine-wide **global store**), misread it as project memory, and silently accrete events into it — then crash on commands that expected an `issues/` directory. Discovery (both the CWD check and the walk-up) now only accepts an *initialized* project dir — one containing the `config.toml` that `pjm init` always writes and the global store never has. Found by dogfooding 0.1.4 on this very repo.

### Also fixed (caught by the 0.1.4 testing playground)

- `pjm precheck payment.py auth.py` — checking *named* files now works from the CLI. The module docstring had advertised a `--files` option that was never wired up; files are now a positional argument (staged files remain the default).
- `pjm search payment.py` now matches the **`location`** field, so per-file lookups behave like precheck: attempts logged with `--at payment.py` are findable by filename (previously search only scanned summary/notes/files).

### Event schema

One new **optional** field: `supersedes` (event id) on decision events. Existing logs parse unchanged; older projectmem versions ignore the field. The 14-tool MCP surface is unchanged (`add_decision` gained an optional parameter; `search_events`/`precheck_file` outputs got richer). 23 new tests (81 total).

**`pjm visualize` gets an Overview landing and a light "product" redesign — the whole dashboard now matches the projectmem brand, and the new first screen shows all four lenses at a glance.** Opening `pjm visualize` used to drop you straight into the Story Map force graph and make you tab around to assemble a mental picture. 0.1.4 adds an **Overview** tab (now the default) that puts the four lenses — failure heatmap, ROI, project structure, and timeline — in a single 2×2 glance, and re-themes the entire dashboard from the old dark palette to a clean light theme drawn from the poster/brand colors.

### New: Overview tab (default landing)

The first thing you see is now a calm, all-at-once summary instead of a graph you have to interpret:

- **Story Map → failure heatmap.** The top files ranked by effort burned (failed attempts ×3 + mentions), bar colour deepening from blue to red with failure intensity. The one chart that answers "where is this project bleeding time?" without a single click.
- **ROI Dashboard → headline cards + a prevention-grade gauge.** Tokens saved, debugging hours saved, USD saved, plus a real A+→F semicircle gauge bound to `pjm score` (same single ROI model — no second source of truth). The gauge colour tracks the grade band.
- **Project Map → compact node graph.** A 10-node summary of `PROJECT_MAP.md` with folders larger, and a red dashed ring on any file that has recorded failures — so structure and pain show up together.
- **Timeline → swimlanes.** issue / attempt / fix / decision as four horizontal lanes of dots across the project's real date range, with an auto-scaled month axis.

Each panel has an `open ↗` link that jumps to the full interactive tab.

### Light "product" re-theme across every tab

The dashboard's CSS variables were re-grounded in the projectmem brand palette (navy header, blue/teal/coral accents on a light surface). Story Map, ROI, Project Map (tree + graph), and Timeline were all audited for dark-only colours — invisible-on-light graph labels and the dark legend/tooltip cards are fixed — so the four detail tabs and the new Overview now read as one coherent app. The grade/score for the gauge is injected via a new `{{SCORE_DATA}}` payload built from `calculate_score`. No data-model or CLI-surface changes; `pjm visualize` flags are unchanged.

## 0.1.3

**Six focused improvements: schema enrichment, secret redaction, the conda/venv hook fix (L-047), stack-aware PROJECT_MAP (L-048), MCP config printed at end of init (L-049), and a silent post-commit auto-capture (L-050).** A metadata pass that lifts Glama tool-quality scores from 75% with one B-tool to a projected ~90% all-A; a privacy guardrail that scrubs accidentally-pasted credentials before they hit disk; a regression fix that restores the pre-commit warning for every conda / pyenv / venv user; and two `pjm init` UX additions that remove the two biggest first-run friction points — *"what is this project?"* and *"how do I wire this up?"*.

### `pjm init` now pre-populates PROJECT_MAP.md from your stack (L-048)

Before 0.1.3, `PROJECT_MAP.md` was a `Status: not created yet` placeholder that an AI session had to fill in by re-reading every manifest and folder — exactly the kind of token-burn projectmem is supposed to prevent. `pjm init` now reads `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` directly and writes an actual map: project description, stack tags + frameworks + key libraries, main folders, and entry points. The Setup-Mode prompt becomes *refining* the map, not building it from zero. Skip with `--no-stack-detect`. **Safety:** only overwrites when the current map still contains the placeholder marker — a human- or AI-edited map is never clobbered.

### `pjm init` now prints the MCP client config block at the end (L-049)

Every new user used to ask the same question right after `pjm init`: *"OK, what JSON do I paste, and where?"* The README had it, but six clicks deep. Now init ends with a copy-pasteable config block (absolute `sys.executable` baked in to dodge the Claude-Desktop / Cursor PATH-inheritance gotcha) plus the on-disk config-file paths for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Antigravity (legacy IDE), and Codex (TOML reminder included). Skip with `--no-mcp-config`. Notes the Antigravity v2 path may differ — the v1 path is the verified one.

### Post-commit auto-capture no longer prints over the shell prompt (L-050)

The post-commit / post-merge hooks run `pjm _auto-capture` in the background (with `&`). Before 0.1.3 the snippet redirected only stderr (`2>/dev/null`), so the success line — *"[projectmem] Auto-captured: …"* — printed to stdout *after* `git commit` had already returned the prompt to the user. Visually it looked like the terminal was stuck waiting for input; users would press Ctrl-C to "recover" when in fact their keystrokes were already being captured by the shell. Now both streams are redirected (`>/dev/null 2>&1 &`), so the capture stays silent. Verify it ran via `pjm show` if you want to see the event.

### Pre-commit warning silently no-op under conda / venv (L-047, fixed)

### Pre-commit warning silently no-op under conda / venv (L-047, fixed)

The killer feature — `git commit` warning you about repeating a failed approach — was silently broken for the majority of Python users since 0.1.1. The installed hook relied on `command -v pjm` to find the binary at commit time. Git invokes hooks via a non-interactive bash, which does not run `.zshrc` / `.bashrc`, so conda / pyenv / venv PATH modifications were absent and the lookup quietly returned nothing. The hook ran, found no `pjm`, exited 0, and produced no output. Users saw a normal commit and assumed projectmem had no warning to give. In fact it had the warning, ready, in memory — and no way to deliver it.

The fix: `install_hooks` now resolves the absolute path to `pjm` (via `shutil.which`, falling back to `sys.prefix/bin/pjm`) at install time and bakes it into the hook as `PJM_BIN="/abs/path/to/pjm"`. A runtime `command -v` fallback remains for the rare case where the install-time binary was later moved. The hook script's `if [ -d ".projectmem" ] && [ -n "$PJM_BIN" ]` guard means a stale path still degrades gracefully instead of erroring at commit time.

Verified end-to-end with a regression test that simulates git's non-interactive hook environment (stripped PATH, no shell init), and with a real `git commit` in a conda-installed setup — the warning now appears reliably. Users who installed projectmem before 0.1.3 need to run `pjm hooks install` once after upgrading to refresh the baked path.

### Secret redaction on write (new)

projectmem stores event text verbatim in `.projectmem/events.jsonl` — that's the local-first promise. The flip side is that a careless paste ("the bug repros when I set `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`") used to land that key on disk in plain text, often in a file that's then committed to git. Starting in 0.1.3, `storage.append_event` runs a conservative pattern scrubber across the event's user-supplied text fields (`summary`, `notes`, `command`, `git_message`, `location`) **before** anything touches disk. Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED:<kind>]` and a one-line stderr notice fires so the user knows redaction happened.

Patterns covered: OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter `sk-…` keys, GitHub classic tokens (`ghp_…`, `gho_…`, `ghu_…`, `ghs_…`, `ghr_…`) and fine-grained PATs (`github_pat_…`), AWS access key IDs (`AKIA…`), Google API keys (`AIza…`), Slack tokens (`xox[abprs]-…`), Stripe live/test keys (`sk_live_…`, `pk_live_…`, etc.), JWTs (`eyJ…`), `Bearer` tokens, and PEM private-key block headers. Patterns are intentionally narrow — anchored to recognisable prefixes with minimum-length requirements — so ordinary debugging prose (`"tried contain: layout"`, `"forgot password reset flow"`) is never touched. 29 new tests pin both the true-positive and false-positive behavior.

Default on. Escape hatch: `PROJECTMEM_NO_REDACT=1` skips scrubbing entirely (for debugging the redactor itself or for trusted offline contexts). Redaction is wrapped in a defensive try/except so a scrubber bug never blocks the primary write path — better a logged secret than a lost event in a tool whose job is logging.

### MCP tool schema enrichment

No behavior changes; this gives every tool's parameters real `description` fields in the JSON schema (via Pydantic `Field` annotations through FastMCP), plus a one-line side-effect / read-only callout in each tool's docstring.

The Glama tool-quality evaluator was flagging Parameters at 1-2/5 across the entire surface because parameters had only names and types — agents had to guess what `summary`, `location`, `outcome`, `library`, `tokens`, `focus`, `query`, `limit`, `issue_id`, and `file_path` actually meant. They now have explicit descriptions and, where useful, schema constraints:

- `search_events.limit` now enforces `1 ≤ limit ≤ 100` in the schema.
- `record_attempt.outcome` now enforces the pattern `^(worked|failed|partial)$` — invalid outcomes are rejected at the schema layer, not silently coerced.
- `get_context.tokens` now enforces `100 ≤ tokens ≤ 20000`.

Every tool also gained one short docstring line stating side effects (e.g., *"Appends an `issue` event to `.projectmem/events.jsonl`, creates an issue file in `.projectmem/issues/`, updates `summary.md`, and marks this issue as the active one"*) or its read-only nature. The MCP `instructions=` block was already strong and was left alone.

**What didn't change:** function bodies, return values, defaults, parameter names, parameter order, the 14-tool surface, the CLI, storage layout, hooks, watcher, and the test suite (still 12/12 passing). All existing MCP client configurations continue to work without modification.

Bumped to 0.1.3 to publish the richer schema to both PyPI and the official MCP Registry. Detailed per-tool analysis and rollback plan in [report/GLAMA_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](report/GLAMA_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md).

## 0.1.2

**Metadata-only republish to satisfy the official MCP Registry's package-ownership check.** Added the line `mcp-name: io.github.riponcm/projectmem` to `README.md` so the registry can verify the GitHub namespace owner (`riponcm`) controls the published PyPI package. No code or behavior changes.

## 0.1.1

**First stable public release.** v0.0.6 was the intelligence layer; v0.1.1 is the polish + cross-client verification + cross-project memory wiring that makes it ready for general use. 46 lessons logged from soft-launch dogfooding and live verification, a 22-item batch polish-pass + 6 follow-up fixes, plus **end-to-end verification across all 4 major MCP clients** (Antigravity, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex) **and across 3 language ecosystems** (JavaScript, Python, Go) for cross-project memory.

This is the version we're comfortable putting on real PyPI. The CLI surface, MCP tool list, event schema, and `.projectmem/` layout are stable from here — future minor versions (0.2.0, etc.) will add features, not break the existing contract.

### Cross-project memory — wiring restored (the big one)

The "Cross-Project Knowledge" diagram on the landing page promised library gotchas to propagate machine-wide. Verification revealed it shipped half-built — three concrete gaps fixed before 0.1.1:

- **Auto-promote never fired on writes (L-043)** — `auto_promote_event` existed in `global_memory.py` but no write path called it. Every `record_attempt` / `add_decision` / `add_note` (MCP and CLI) silently skipped global promotion. Wired into `storage.append_event` so every write surface now promotes consistently. Plus word-boundary library matching (no more "gin" inside "imagineering") + stack-filter (a vite project mentioning "next" in plain English no longer creates a fake Next.js gotcha).
- **Library set was JS/Python-only (L-045)** — the hardcoded `PROMOTABLE_LIBRARIES` set covered React/Vue/Next/Vite/FastAPI/Django and not much else. Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, .NET, mobile — all silently dropped at promotion time. Replaced with a self-curating cache at `~/.projectmem/global/.promotable.json`: every library `detect_stack` ever sees in a manifest on this machine becomes promotable. A Go user's `gin` decisions now propagate exactly like a React user's `vite` ones.
- **Every library mention was treated as a gotcha (L-046)** — `add_decision("Use FastAPI for this project")` used to pollute the global store with project-local setup choices. Now there's an explicit signal filter: failed/partial attempts always promote (the outcome is the signal); decisions/notes only promote when their summary opens with `gotcha:` / `lesson:` / `warning:` / `caution:` / `pitfall:` / `avoid:` / `don't` / `do not` / `never` / `bug:`. Result on the test cycle: signal-to-noise went from 14% to 100%.

End-to-end verification across `globaltest/proj-react`, `proj-next`, `proj-python`, and `proj-go`: a `vite` gotcha logged in proj-react surfaces in proj-next with `source_project` attribution, stays out of proj-python and proj-go's responses, and a `gin` gotcha logged in proj-go promotes correctly under the new library cache + signal filter. Full results in [report/CROSS_PROJECT_TEST_PLAN.md](report/CROSS_PROJECT_TEST_PLAN.md).

### Bug fixes (the launch blockers)

- **MCP stdio integrity (L-009 + L-010)** — write tools used to corrupt the JSON-RPC stream via `typer.echo`, and one bad call would kill the entire session. Every tool body now runs inside a stdout-suppression context + a `@safe_tool` exception wrapper. Five consecutive write-tool calls survive cleanly in any client.
- **MCP project-root discovery (L-005)** — server used to fail with *"No .projectmem directory found"* when the MCP client launched it from its own CWD. New parent-walk fallback (like git does for `.git/`), plus a `--root` flag and `PROJECTMEM_ROOT` env var for explicit pinning.
- **Silent issue misattribution (L-027a)** — `pjm attempt` after a `pjm fix` used to silently attach to whatever issue was still open. Now uses a `.projectmem/.current_issue` marker, a 5-minute time-fence on the fallback, and an explicit `--issue <id>` flag.
- **Partial attempts dropped from summary (L-027b)** — `summary.md` only surfaced `failed` attempts; `partial` outcomes vanished even though they contained valuable signal. Now both render.
- **Project purpose stuck on placeholder (L-037)** — `summary.md`'s Project purpose section never escaped its init placeholder. Now auto-syncs from `PROJECT_MAP.md`'s `## Project purpose` section on every regeneration.

### Behavioral fixes

- **AI workflow alignment (L-028 / L-031 / L-036)** — three surfaces used to tell the AI different things about the session-start trio (MCP `instructions=` field, `CLAUDE.md` bridge, `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` template). All three now mirror each other: `get_instructions` → `get_summary` → `get_project_map`, plus the *"never edit `.projectmem/` files directly via filesystem write"* rule.
- **AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md rewrite (L-036)** — was CLI-only and out of sync with MCP. Now lists both MCP tools and CLI commands per trigger, distinguishes Setup Mode vs Maintenance Mode by concrete placeholder phrases (not "files populated"), and gives AI clients an imperative 6-step Setup procedure.
- **`pjm init` writes a CLAUDE.md bridge (L-004f)** — marker-bounded block at project root, idempotent on re-init. AI clients (Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor) honor the memory layer by default.

### Quality of life

- **ROI surfaces reconciled (L-025d)** — `pjm stats` and `pjm score` used to report different `tokens_saved` numbers. `pjm stats` is now a thin presentation layer over `score.calculate_score` — single source of truth.
- **`pjm score --verbose` works (L-025a)** — was a no-op; now appends per-component event detail so you can audit exactly why the score is what it is.
- **`pjm stats --format json` (L-025b)** — CI-friendly JSON output matching `pjm score`'s format flag.
- **`pjm visualize --output / --no-open` (L-024b)** — choose where the HTML lands, skip auto-open (CI / headless).
- **`pjm search --regex` (L-027c)** — opt-in regex / OR-pattern search.
- **`pjm attempt --issue <id> / --auto-issue`** — explicit issue attribution + auto-creation of an implicit parent issue when none is open.
- **`pjm wrap` File Gotchas filter (L-022a)** — auto-backfill events used to pollute the gotchas section with the same generic note per file. Filtered out.
- **`pjm global` ergonomics (L-026b)** — `pjm global add "..." --library X` auto-routes to `add-gotcha`. Plus `--format json` on `list` / `detect` (L-026c).
- **Framework detection word-boundary fix (L-026a)** — `pjm global detect` no longer flags `gin` (Go framework) when scanning a React project with `eslint-plugin-react` (substring match on `plugin`). Word-boundary regex now.
- **Timestamp normalization (L-024a)** — `pjm visualize`'s Timeline used to show "INVALID DATE" on auto-backfill events. All events normalized to ISO-Zulu on write + defensive parser in the dashboard.
- **HIGH CHURN counter via git log (L-023a)** — was reading from event log (stale); now sources from `git log --since=N.days.ago` (live).

### Cross-client MCP verification

All four major 2026 MCP clients tested end-to-end against a real project:

- **Antigravity** — first client dogfooded; entire v0.0.6 bug list was found here, batch fix landed, every category re-verified.
- **Claude Desktop** — must use **Auto mode** (Plan mode bypasses MCP), pass project root via **`--root` in args** (the `cwd` JSON field is silently ignored in current builds), worktree mode requires init inside the worktree.
- **Cursor** — same `--root` workaround for the cwd-ignored bug. Per-project `.cursor/mcp.json` supported.
- **Codex** — config is **TOML at `~/.codex/config.toml`** (not JSON), UI Save button can silently fail (edit the file directly), set **reasoning effort to `medium` or higher** for the full session-start trio.

### Docs

- **README hero + demo images** now hosted on a separate public asset repo (`github.com/projectmem/projectmemdoc`) and referenced via `raw.githubusercontent.com`. PyPI's README renderer can fetch them regardless of the projectmem repo's visibility. Animated GIF (8-frame, Safari-safe) replaces the SVG that PyPI rendered inconsistently.
- **All 4 MCP clients' UI navigation paths documented** in README + Guide (Settings → Developer → ..., Settings → Tools & MCPs → ..., etc.).
- **First-run permission prompts callout** — documented as normal MCP-client behavior, not a bug.
- **Stale MCP server process troubleshooting** — common gotcha when iterating on MCP config; documented diagnostic commands + recovery.

### Carried over to v0.0.8 backlog

- L-038 (`pjm watch` duplicate churn events for one incident) — known cosmetic noise; documented fix queued for v0.0.8 polish.
- Universal AI Bridge (`pjm bridge install`, `pjm doctor`) — multi-bridge `pjm init` writing `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.

---

## 0.0.6

projectmem transforms from a passive memory logger into an active intelligence layer. Zero-friction capture, intelligent injection, provable ROI, cross-project knowledge.

### Major Features

- **Auto-Capture Engine** — git hooks now classify commits into the right event types automatically. `revert` becomes a failed attempt, `fix:` becomes a fix event, `feat:` becomes a note, `BREAKING` becomes a decision. Zero manual logging required for common cases.
- **Pre-Commit Warnings (`pjm precheck`)** — the killer feature: warns you BEFORE you commit if you're about to repeat a failed approach, modify a high-churn file, or touch an unresolved issue. No other AI tool can do this — it requires the memory layer underneath.
- **Smart Context Injection (`pjm wrap`)** — wraps your AI agent (Claude, Cursor, Aider) and auto-injects a token-budgeted context block before the session starts. Inject into `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, or clipboard.
- **Failure Prevention Score (`pjm score`)** — quantifiable ROI metric with letter grade (A+ through F). Tracks failed approaches on record, decisions documented, debugging hours saved, tokens saved, USD saved. Outputs as terminal display, JSON for CI, or shields.io badge for README.
- **Context Budget Optimizer (`pjm context`)** — generate token-budgeted project memory tailored to file focus and time window. Four compression levels (full / compressed / ultra / emergency). Git-aware — boosts events for files currently being worked on.
- **Cross-Project Global Memory (`pjm global`)** — knowledge that follows the developer across projects. Stores patterns, library gotchas, and stack preferences in `~/.projectmem/global/`. Auto-detects stack on `pjm init` (Python, JS, Rust, Go, Java) and inherits relevant gotchas. Export/import for team sharing.

### Enhancements

- **Auto-installed hooks on `pjm init`** — git hooks are installed automatically. No need to remember `pjm hooks install`. Opt out with `--no-hooks`.
- **Three hooks now installed**: `post-commit`, `post-merge`, and `pre-commit` (for `pjm precheck`).
- **Safe hook installation** — appends to existing hooks with clearly-marked snippets. Never overwrites. Clean uninstall removes only projectmem's section.
- **Visualization overhaul for auto-capture**:
  - New header stat: auto-captured event count
  - `AUTO` badge on auto-captured events in Timeline
  - New ROI cards: Manual / Auto-captured / Would Be Lost / Auto-capture Rate
  - New Capture Sources donut chart (git commits vs reverts vs manual)
  - New File Churn heatmap (top 10 files by activity, color-coded severity)
  - Manual/Auto filter pills in Timeline
  - Dashed borders + transparency on auto-captured nodes in Story Map
- **Event model extension**: `auto_captured`, `capture_source`, `capture_confidence`, `git_message` (backward compatible).
- **AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md template updated** with auto-capture awareness section telling AI agents what's auto-captured vs what still needs manual logging.
- **Hidden `_auto-capture` command** for internal use by git hooks.

### Real-Time File Watcher (`pjm watch`)

- **New command:** `pjm watch [--daemon|--stop|--status]` — opt-in real-time file watcher that detects high churn (4+ edits to the same file within 10 min) and auto-logs them as churn-detector events.
- **Auto-starts on `pjm init`** in interactive terminals — zero-touch experience. Skipped in CI/CD, piped output, and non-TTY environments to avoid zombie daemons.
- **Battery-aware:** idles when no activity, gitignore-aware, single-instance lock via PID file at `.projectmem/watch.pid`, graceful SIGTERM shutdown.
- **Project Map tree view:** new horizontal dendrogram (D3 cluster + bezier links) with zoom/pan, toggleable against the existing force-graph view.
- **Opt-out flag:** `pjm init --no-watch` for power users or battery-conscious environments.

### Zero-Touch Setup

- **Auto-backfill on `pjm init`** — automatically ingests the last 20 git commits as classified events. Fresh repos = silent no-op. Existing repos = instant dashboard with real data. Opt out with `pjm init --no-backfill`.
- **Auto-installed git hooks** + **auto-started watcher** + **auto-backfilled history** + **auto-inherited global memory** all happen in a single `pjm init` call. From `pip install` to active memory in two commands.

### MCP Server Expansion (8 → 14 tools)

Native MCP server now exposes intelligence-layer capabilities to AI agents, not just raw memory:

- **`precheck_file(path)`** — AI can self-check a file's failure history *before* proposing changes (turns memory into proactive judgment).
- **`get_issue(id)`** — lazy-load one specific issue file for token efficiency.
- **`search_events(query, limit)`** — plain-text search over the event log instead of loading the full summary.
- **`get_score()`** — AI can report the prevention score with hours/tokens/dollars saved.
- **`get_context(tokens, focus)`** — AI requests an on-demand token-budgeted context block.
- **`get_global_gotchas(library)`** — AI queries cross-project memory for library-specific lessons.

Existing 8 tools (`get_summary`, `log_issue`, `record_attempt`, `record_fix`, `add_decision`, `add_note`, `get_instructions`, `get_project_map`) unchanged.

### Privacy & Security

- **`SECURITY.md`** at repo root with vulnerability disclosure policy and threat model.
- **Privacy & Security section** in the user guide explaining the team-memory-via-git pattern, local-first guarantees, prompt-injection considerations, and uninstall path.
- **Cleaner gitignore default** — only `events.jsonl`, `watch.pid`, `watch.log` are ignored by default, allowing `summary.md` / `PROJECT_MAP.md` / `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to be shared via git. Opt into total privacy by adding `.projectmem/` to `.gitignore`.

### Dependencies

- `watchdog>=4.0` promoted from optional to required dependency — required for the auto-started file watcher. Adds ~70KB to install size.

### Breaking Changes

None — v0.0.6 is purely additive. Existing `events.jsonl` files continue to work without modification.

## 0.0.4

- **Major Feature**: Complete overhaul of `viz.html` into a stunning, single-page Tabbed Dashboard (Story Map, ROI Dashboard, Project Map, Timeline).
- **Major Feature**: Automated D3.js Architecture Graph generation—`pjm visualize` now natively parses your Markdown `PROJECT_MAP.md` into an interactive node graph with zero extra AI tokens.
- **Enhancement**: Upgraded dashboard aesthetic to a high-end, soothing "Midnight Blue & Indigo" professional palette to reduce developer eye strain.
- **Enhancement**: Added explicit documentation and guarantees in the README for configuring native MCP vs Custom System Prompts for 100% hands-free workflows.

## 0.0.3

- **Major Feature**: Native MCP Server (`pjm-mcp`) for direct integration with Claude Desktop and Cursor.
- **Major Feature**: Interactive D3.js visualization (`pjm visualize`) showing project story and technical debt heatmap.
- **Major Feature**: Auto-backfill (`pjm backfill`) to ingest git history into project memory.
- **Major Feature**: Token ROI Dashboard (`pjm stats`) to calculate and visualize AI tokens saved.
- **Major Feature**: 3-Level Auto-Tracking system for hands-free memory management:
  - Level 1: Trigger-based `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with MANDATORY rules that force AI agents to log work automatically.
  - Level 2: MCP server with built-in system prompt and proactive tool descriptions (MANDATORY/IMMEDIATELY language).
  - Level 3: Auto-capture Git Hooks that log `revert`, `fix:`, `feat:`, and `BREAKING` commits passively.
- **Enhancement**: Added `pjm` alias globally to prevent conflicts with other system tools.
- **Enhancement**: Added location metadata (`--at`) support to all logging commands.
- **Enhancement**: Added `get_instructions()` MCP tool so AI agents can read project rules natively.
- **Enhancement**: Added "Maintenance Mode" logic to `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to prevent redundant structural mapping.
- **Fix**: Corrected JavaScript syntax error in D3.js forceLink chain that prevented visualization rendering.

## 0.0.2

- Add `.projectmem/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` during initialization.
- Add `.projectmem/PROJECT_MAP.md` as the AI-created structural map placeholder.
- Add `pm instructions` to print the project AI memory protocol.
- Add `pm map` to print the project map.
- Improve the initial `summary.md` so new projects are not blank.

## 0.0.1

- Initial local MVP scaffold.
